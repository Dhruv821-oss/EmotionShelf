🌙 EmotionShelf — Let Your Feelings Pick the Story
EmotionShelf is an AI-powered literary companion that lets your emotions choose what you read. Simply enter a sentence that reflects how you're feeling, and EmotionShelf will detect the emotion behind it—joy, sadness, fear, love, anger, and more—and match it with a carefully chosen literary theme. From there, the app recommends rare and timeless books from the public domain via the Gutendex API (Project Gutenberg).

Whether you're heartbroken and need solace in a tragedy, or overjoyed and seeking a happy tale, EmotionShelf becomes your secret bookshelf, curated by how you feel inside.
